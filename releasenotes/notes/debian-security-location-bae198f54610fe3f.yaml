    Debian changed locations for its security package repos. We had been
    accounting for that with specific overrides for some time. Enough time
    has now passed where all modern Debian releases use a consistent
    security package repo location so we have dropped the special accounting
    to make adding new Debian releases simpler. Note, this means DIB no
    longer supports building Debian older than Bullseye.
