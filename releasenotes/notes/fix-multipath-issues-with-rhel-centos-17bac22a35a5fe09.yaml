    Fixes an issue on RHEL or Centos based image builds where an initial 
    source image state may have a multipath capible initial ramdisk,
    but then lack the necessary package to support regeneration of a new
    ramdisk with multipathing. The end result being that a regenerated or
    updated ramdisk after the fact is that the ramdisk then fails to boot
    when multipath devices are present where it previously booted without
    any issues. This is because the ramdisk build process used by ``dracut``
    does not fail if it does not find the necessary multipath components,
    thus requiring the ``device-mapper-multipath`` package to be present
    for the ramdisk with the necessary artifacts.
