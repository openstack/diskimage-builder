=====
Use RHEL 7 cloud images as the baseline for built disk images.

Note: As of this writing, RHEL 7 is still in beta, so final download
locations are not available.  This element defaults to using the RHEL 6.5
image, but that will need to be overridden using the appropriate DIB_*
environment variables to point at a RHEL 7 image.

For further details see the redhat-common README.
