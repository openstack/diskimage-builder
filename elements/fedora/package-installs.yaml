# On a fresh Fedora 18 install you might have to update audit in order to
# fix a conflict with a file from the glibc package.

audit:

# The version of openssl shipped in the fedora cloud image is no longer
# compatible with new python environments installed by virtualenv, so we need
# to update it first.
# See https://bugs.launchpad.net/diskimage-builder/+bug/1254879
openssl:

# FIXME: To avoid conflict between the pyOpenSSL installed via python-pip
# and pyOpenSSL installed via yum, we are going to sort it out installing
# it earlier at the beginning of the image building process. Pyhton-pip
# is installing pyOpenSSL as part of satisfying the requirements.txt
# in python-glanceclient and afterwards yum tries to install it as a
# dependency of the python-paste package needed for the heat element,
# this seems to be conflicting and causing the image building process to
# fail. The problem is hapenning on a Fedora 18 system.

# Newer Fedora 21 splits these out into a separate package.
# It contains iscsi_tcp.ko (for Ironic) among other things like network

# This small package is required on Fedora 21 in order to build some
